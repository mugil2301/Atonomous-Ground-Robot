# Atonomous-Ground-Robot
Developed a python package for semi-autonomous ground robot to traverse over a complex unweighted graph arena with responsive AR(Augmented Reality) objects distributed over the arena built using OpenGL framework. April-tags were adapted for precised positioning of AR object. And build a robot to traverse on the path.
